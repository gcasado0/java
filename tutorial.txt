The most basic control flow statement supported by the Java programming language is the if-else statement.
The switch statement allows for any number of possible execution paths.
The do-while statement is similar to the while statement, but evaluates its expression at the beginning of the loop.
How do you write an infinite loop using the for statement? for (;;);
How do you write an infinite loop using the while statement? while(true){};

Questions
Consider the following class:

public class IdentifyMyParts {
    public static int x = 7; 
    public int y = 3; 
}
What are the class variables? x

What are the instance variables? y

What is the output from the following code:

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5;
b.y = 6;
a.x = 1;
b.x = 2;
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y); 5
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y); 6
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x); 2
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x); 2
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x); 2

1.What's wrong with the following program?

public class SomethingIsWrong {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle myRect;
        myRect.width = 40;
        myRect.height = 50;
        System.out.println("myRect's area is " + myRect.area());
    }
}
Rta: nunca crea un objeto myRect con el metodo new.


2.The following code creates one array and one string object. 

...
String[] students = new String[10]; //1 referencia
String studentName = "Peter Parker"; //1 referencia
students[0] = studentName; //1 referencia
studentName = null; //se elimino una referencia
...
How many references to those objects exist after the code executes? 
Rta: 2
students --> array of strings object
students[0] --> string object

Is either object eligible for garbage collection? 
Rta: no porque ambos tienen una referencia 


3. How does a program destroy an object that it creates?
Rta: assing a null to the reference

4. Fix the program called SomethingIsWrong shown in Question 1.

public class SomethingIsWrong {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle myRect = new Rectangle();
        myRect.width = 40;
        myRect.height = 50;
        System.out.println("myRect's area is " + myRect.area());
    }
}

Given the following class, called NumberHolder, write some code that creates an instance of the class, initializes its two member variables, and then displays the value of each member variable.

public class NumberHolder {
    public int anInt;
    public float aFloat;
}
