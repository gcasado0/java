The most basic control flow statement supported by the Java programming language is the if-else statement.
The switch statement allows for any number of possible execution paths.
The do-while statement is similar to the while statement, but evaluates its expression at the beginning of the loop.
How do you write an infinite loop using the for statement? for (;;);
How do you write an infinite loop using the while statement? while(true){};

Questions
Consider the following class:

public class IdentifyMyParts {
    public static int x = 7; 
    public int y = 3; 
}
What are the class variables? x

What are the instance variables? y

What is the output from the following code:

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5;
b.y = 6;
a.x = 1;
b.x = 2;
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y); 5
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y); 6
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x); 2
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x); 2
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x); 2

1.What's wrong with the following program?

public class SomethingIsWrong {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle myRect;
        myRect.width = 40;
        myRect.height = 50;
        System.out.println("myRect's area is " + myRect.area());
    }
}
Rta: nunca crea un objeto myRect con el metodo new.


2.The following code creates one array and one string object. 

...
String[] students = new String[10]; //1 referencia
String studentName = "Peter Parker"; //1 referencia
students[0] = studentName; //1 referencia
studentName = null; //se elimino una referencia
...
How many references to those objects exist after the code executes? 
Rta: 2
students --> array of strings object
students[0] --> string object

Is either object eligible for garbage collection? 
Rta: no porque ambos tienen una referencia 


3. How does a program destroy an object that it creates?
Rta: assing a null to the reference

4. Fix the program called SomethingIsWrong shown in Question 1.

public class SomethingIsWrong {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle myRect = new Rectangle();
        myRect.width = 40;
        myRect.height = 50;
        System.out.println("myRect's area is " + myRect.area());
    }
}

Given the following class, called NumberHolder, write some code that creates an instance of the class, initializes its two member variables, and then displays the value of each member variable.

public class NumberHolder {
    public int anInt;
    public float aFloat;
}

Questions and Exercises: Nested Classes
Questions
1. The program Problem.java doesn't compile. 
What do you need to do to make it compile?  hacer que s sea static
Why? porque la clase inner local es static


2. Use the Java API documentation for the Box class (in the javax.swing package) to help you answer the following questions.

What static nested class does Box define?
static class 	Box.Filler

What inner class does Box define?
protected class 	Box.AccessibleBox

What is the superclass of Box's inner class?
javax.swing.JComponent o javax.swing.Box

Which of Box's nested classes can you use from any class?
static class 	Box.Filler

How do you create an instance of Box's Filler class?
cuando se crea un objeto box o new Box.Filler();


Exercises
1. Get the file Class1.java. Compile and run Class1. What is the output?
InnerClass1: getString invoked.
InnerClass1: getAnotherString invoked.

2. The following exercises involve modifying the class DataStructure.java, which the section
 Inner Class Example discusses.

a.Define a method named print(DataStructureIterator iterator). 
Invoke this method with an instance of the class EvenIterator 
so that it performs the same function as the method printEven.

b.Invoke the method print(DataStructureIterator iterator) so that it prints elements 
that have an odd index value. Use an anonymous class as the method's argument instead 
of an instance of the interface DataStructureIterator.

c.Define a method named print(java.util.function.Function<Integer, Boolean> iterator) 
that performs the same function as print(DataStructureIterator iterator). 
Invoke this method with a lambda expression to print elements that have an even index value. 
Invoke this method again with a lambda expression to print elements that have an odd index value.

d.Define two methods so that the following two statements 
print elements that have an even index value and elements that have an odd index value:

    DataStructure ds = new DataStructure()
    // ...
    ds.print(DataStructure::isEvenIndex);
    ds.print(DataStructure::isOddIndex);

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions and Exercises: Annotations
Questions
What is wrong with the following interface?

public interface House {
    @Deprecated  
    void open();--> define un metodo que esta deprecado
    void openFrontDoor();
    void openBackDoor();
}

Consider this implementation of the House interface, shown in Question 1.

public class MyHouse implements House {
    public void open() {}
    public void openFrontDoor() {}
    public void openBackDoor() {}
}
If you compile this program, the compiler produces a warning because open was deprecated (in the interface). 
What can you do to get rid of that warning?
se puede usar esta anotacion: @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")

Will the following code compile without error? Why or why not?

public @interface Meal { ... }

@Meal("breakfast", mainDish="cereal")
@Meal("lunch", mainDish="pizza")
@Meal("dinner", mainDish="salad")
public void evaluateDiet() { ... }


Questions and Exercises: Interfaces

1. What methods would a class that implements the java.lang.CharSequence interface have to implement?
rta:
    char charAt(int index)
    int length()
    CharSequence subSequence(int start, int end)
    String toString()

2. What is wrong with the following interface?
    public interface SomethingIsWrong {
        void aMethod(int aValue){
            System.out.println("Hi Mom");
        }
    }
rta: implementa un metodo que no es default ni static

3. Fix the interface in question 2.
rta:
    public interface SomethingIsWrong {
        default void aMethod(int aValue){
            System.out.println("Hi Mom");
        }
    }

 4. Is the following interface valid?
    public interface Marker {
    }
rta: creo que no, porque no tiene ningun metodo
correcion: si es correcta


Exercises
1. Write a class that implements the CharSequence interface 
found in the java.lang package. 
Your implementation should return the string backwards. 
Select one of the sentences from this book to use as the data. 
Write a small main method to test your class; make sure to call all four methods.

2. Suppose you have written a time server that periodically notifies its clients 
of the current date and time. Write an interface the server could use to enforce 
a particular protocol on its clients.

Ver TimeServer.java
