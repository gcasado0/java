How do you write an infinite loop using the for statement? for (;;);

Questions
Consider the following class:

public class IdentifyMyParts {
    public static int x = 7; 
    public int y = 3; 
}
What are the class variables? x

What are the instance variables? y

What is the output from the following code:

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5;
b.y = 6;
a.x = 1;
b.x = 2;
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y); 5
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y); 6
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x); 2
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x); 2
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x); 2
